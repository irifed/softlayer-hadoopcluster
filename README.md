=======================

Hadoop distribution from Apache website is built in 32-bit mode.
In order to use Hadoop on a 64-bit machine it is necessary to build 64-bit version from scratch, otherwise Hadoop does
not start correctly.
I have built 64-bit Hadoop 2.4.1 from sources: [download here](http://hadoop-2.4.1-64bit.s3.amazonaws.com/hadoop-2.4.1-x86_64.tar.gz)
